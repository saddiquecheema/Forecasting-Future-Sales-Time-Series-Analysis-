# Sales Forecasting with XGBoost + LightGBM (Blended Model)

This project predicts daily sales using **Machine Learning models** (XGBoost & LightGBM) blended together.  
It uses historical sales data, lag features, rolling averages, and date-based features for better forecasting.  
A **Streamlit interface** is also provided to visualize predictions vs actual values in a business-friendly dashboard.
